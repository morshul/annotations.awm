# Awesome EmmyLua

## About

AwesomeWM doesn't have good support for Lua autocompletion, so this repository is intended to rewrite documentation entirely by hand, without using generation tools.

- AwesomeWM Official Website: https://awesomewm.org/
- Lua Official Website: https://www.lua.org/

## Usage

We work with Lua using the LSP server [`lua-language-server`](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/) created by [sumneko](https://github.com/sumneko/), where its type annotations are based on [EmmyLua annotations](https://emmylua.github.io/annotation.html).

- First, clone that repository somewhere on your disk using Git:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/lib
git clone https://github.com/morshul/annotations.awm ~/.local/lib/annotations.awm
```

- If your Lua project folder doesn't have a `.luarc.json`, create one and paste the following lines:
```json
{
  "diagnostics.globals": [
    "awesome",
    "client",
    "mouse",
    "mousegrabber",
    "root",
    "screen",
    "tag"
  ],
  "workspace.library": [
    "~/.local/lib/annotations.awm"
  ]
}
```

- You now have AwesomeWM autocompletion!
